CLTwitterEngine
===============

A simple, ARC and blocks-based Twitter engine for Cocoa and CocoaTouch.  `CLTweetEngine` currently supports both [TweetMarker][tm] and Twitter's image upload service.

Basics
======

`CLTwitterEngine` is designed with the following tenets:

* Calls to and from Twitter should be asynchronous.
* Callbacks will favor blocks, rather than protocols and delegates.
* Clients of the library should be able to provide their own means of signing requests with OAuth information.
* Clients of the library should be able to provide a JSON parser of their choice.  This is to allow use on older versions of Mac OS X and iOS, which do not have [NSJSONSerialization][JSON].
* Objects should know how to get or post themselves, whenever possible.  For example, the `CLTweet` class is capable of getting a tweet or posting one. 
* The API should be as simple as possible.
* Yes, there are [other frameworks][mg], but sometimes you just want to roll your own.  For the hell of it.

Requirements
============
Requires [GTMHttpFetcher][fetcher].

Because you are providing `CLTwitterEngine` with a block of code that will sign OAuth requests (see below), to sign into Twitter using OAuth is entirely your responsibility.  There are frameworks which will handle this exchange for you; `CLTwitterEngine` used [GTMOauthAuthentication][OAuth] during development.

Initialization
==============

To initialize: 

* You must specify a way to convert JSON data to Foundation objects; the assumed way of doing so is using [NSJSONSerialization][JSON], though presumably any framework will do, as long as `NSDictionary`s and `NSArray`s are returned where appropriate.
* You must specify a way to add OAuth authorization to a `NSMutableURLRequest`.  Again, any framework should work, though GTMOauthAuthentication was used during development.

Example:
    
    [[CLTwitterEngine sharedEngine] setAuthorizer:^(NSMutableURLRequest *request)
    {
        // Your authorizing code here
    }];
    [[CLTwitterEngine sharedEngine] setConverter:^(NSData *data)
    {
        // Your code here
    }];

Sample Initialization
=====================

For illustrative purposes, here are the authorizer and converter that are being used to test `CLTwitterEngine`:

    [[CLTwitterEngine sharedEngine] setAuthorizer:^(NSMutableURLRequest *request)
     {
         // ivar: GTMOAuthAuthentication *_auth;
         [_auth authorizeRequest:request];
     }];
    [[CLTwitterEngine sharedEngine] setConverter:^(NSData *data)
    {
        NSError *error;
        return [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data 
                                               options:kNilOptions
                                                 error:&error];
    }];
    
Use
===
    
Subsequent to initialization above, the engine is ready to use.  You can get the timeline by:

    [[CLTwitterEngine sharedEngine] getTimeLineWithCompletionHandler:^(NSArray *timeline, NSError *error) {
        if (error != nil)
        {
            // Handle the error.
        }
        else
        {
            // The timeline is ready for use.  It is a NSArray of CLTweet objects.
        }
    }];
    
You can post a text-only tweet:

    [CLTweet postTweet:@"Look at me; I'm tweeting!" completionHandler:^(CLTweet *tweet, NSError *error) {
        if (error != nil)
        {
            // Handle the error.
        }
        else
        {
            // Your tweet has been posted; the result is provided for convenience.
        }
    }];
    
You can post a tweet with an image:

    [CLTweet postTweet:@"Some clever message." withImage:/*Some_nifty_NSImage*/ completionHandler:^(CLTweet *tweet, NSError *error) {
        if (error != nil)
        {
            // Handle the error.
        }
        else
        {
            // The tweet and image have been posted; the result is provided for convenience.
        }
    }];
    
You can get recent direct messages (both sent and received are in this same array):

    [[CLTwitterEngine sharedEngine] getRecentDirectMessagesWithCompletionHandler:^(NSArray *messages, NSError *innerError) {
        if (innerError != nil)
        {
            // Hanlde the error.
        }
        else
        {
            // The direct messages (sent and received) are ready for use.
            // It is a NSArray of CLDirectMessage objects.
        }
    }];
    
Or perhaps just an individual direct message:

    [CLDirectMessage getDirectMessageWithId:[NSNumber numberWithLongLong:123456789012341234] 
                          completionHandler:^(CLDirectMessage *message, NSError *error) {
        if (error != nil)
        {
            // Handle the error.
        }
        else
        {
            // The direct messages is provided.
        }
    }];

You can get a user by handle/screen name:

    [CLTwitterUser getUserWithScreenName:@"SedgeApp" completionHandler:^(CLTwitterUser *user, NSError *error) {
        if (error != nil)
        {
            // Handle error.
        }
        else
        {
            // The user is provided.
        }
    }
    
...or by ID:

    [CLTwitterUser getUserWithId:[NSNumber numberWithLongLong:123456789012341234] completionHandler:^(CLTwitterUser *user, NSError *error) {
                if (error != nil)
                {
                    // Handle error.
                }
                else
                {
                    // The user is provided.
                }
    }];

TweetMarker
===========

[Tweet Marker][tm] is, in short, a way for one or more Twitter clients to all cooperate and note a user's last read tweet.  It is opt-in, and requires its own API keyâ€“see [the website][tm] for details.

Tweet Marker allows several different "collections" to have marks.  For example, "timeline", or "mentions".  With that in mind...

To retrieve the current marker in the timeline for the user [SedgeApp][s]:

    [CLTweetMarker getLastReadForUsername:@"sedgeapp" 
                             inCollection:@"timeline" 
                               withApiKey:@">>>tweetmarker api key<<<" 
                        completionHandler:^(NSNumber *tweetId, NSError *error) {
                            if (error == nil)
                            {
                                // Handle error.
                            }
                            else
                            {
                                // Scroll your view to the tweet with ID == tweetId.
                            }
    }];

To set the current marker in the timeline:

    [CLTweetMarker markLastReadAsTweet:[NSNumber numberWithLongLong:168739424295854082]
                           forUsername:@"caseyliss"
                          inCollection:@"timeline"
                            withApiKey:@">>>tweetmarker api key<<<"
                     completionHandler:^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
                         if (!success)
                         {
                             // Handle error.
                         }
                         else
                         {
                             // The marker has been set.  Optionally, update your UI to show that.
                         }
                     }];
